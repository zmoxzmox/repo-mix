# Third-Party Notices (Partial Inventory)

Original RepoPrompt CE code is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0, as provided in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). Third-party components remain subject to their own copyright notices and license terms.

This file currently records notice material identified during focused attribution remediation. It is **not** a complete dependency inventory or audit. Additional third-party notice curation remains pending as described in [`docs/open-source-readiness.md`](docs/open-source-readiness.md).

## Sparkle

RepoPrompt CE vendors the upstream Sparkle 2.9.2 Swift Package Manager
distribution. The copied license is included at
[`ThirdPartyLicenses/sparkle/LICENSE`](ThirdPartyLicenses/sparkle/LICENSE), and
the downloaded asset checksum and provenance are recorded under
[`Vendor/Sparkle/`](Vendor/Sparkle/).

## UniversalCharsetDetection / uchardet

RepoPrompt CE vendors UniversalCharsetDetection and uchardet source. Their
copied licenses and author notice are included under
[`ThirdPartyLicenses/universal-charset-detection/`](ThirdPartyLicenses/universal-charset-detection/).

## PCRE2 and SLJIT

RepoPrompt CE includes PCRE2 source and its SLJIT dependency. Their copied
licenses are included at [`ThirdPartyLicenses/pcre2/LICENSE.txt`](ThirdPartyLicenses/pcre2/LICENSE.txt)
and [`ThirdPartyLicenses/sljit/LICENSE`](ThirdPartyLicenses/sljit/LICENSE).

## Tree-sitter grammar packages and runtime

RepoPrompt CE links Tree-sitter grammar package products through fixed, source-preserving SwiftPM revision pins. Those package dependencies still require attribution when distributed.

The curated [`ThirdPartyLicenses/tree-sitter/`](ThirdPartyLicenses/tree-sitter/) bundle maps the directly linked grammar products to their exact upstream repositories and revisions, and includes full license copies for the grammar packages, `SwiftTreeSitter`, its embedded Tree-sitter runtime, and the ICU subset notice shipped with that runtime.

## Markdownosaur

Portions of the following source file are adapted from [Markdownosaur](https://github.com/christianselig/Markdownosaur) by Christian Selig, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0:

- `Sources/RepoPrompt/Infrastructure/UI/Markdown/EnhancedMarkdownCompiler.swift`

The adapted implementation has been substantially modified for RepoPrompt. The Apache-2.0 license text is available in the repository root [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

## wildmatch / OpenBSD-derived fnmatch material

The repository includes wildmatch material in:

- `Sources/RepoPromptC/src/wildmatch/wildmatch.c`
- `Sources/RepoPromptC/include/wildmatch.h`

The source files state that the implementation is based on the fnmatch implementation from OpenBSD. The notice material below is reproduced from the checked-in files; no further external provenance is asserted here.
