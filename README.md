**A free, open-source native macOS app and agent orchestrator for context engineering.**

RepoPrompt CE helps coding agents understand your codebase before they act. It
assembles focused, reviewable context from files, CodeMaps, repository
structure, and Git diffs, then hands that context to AI tools and CLI agents.

RepoPrompt CE also builds an agent harness around its bundled MCP server.
Connect MCP-compatible clients and CLI agents to search repositories, inspect
files, curate context, run agent sessions, and orchestrate work through a shared
native macOS interface.

## Get Started

Choose one of these setup paths. You do not need to open Xcode.

### Install with Homebrew

For the signed and notarized public app, use the dedicated RepoPrompt CE
Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew tap repoprompt/repoprompt-ce
brew install --cask repoprompt-ce
```

This installs `/Applications/RepoPrompt CE.app` from the
[`repoprompt/homebrew-repoprompt-ce`](https://github.com/repoprompt/homebrew-repoprompt-ce)
tap. The cask consumes the promoted public updater ZIP from
[`repoprompt/repoprompt-ce-updates`](https://github.com/repoprompt/repoprompt-ce-updates);
it does not build from source. Source-build paths remain below for contributors
and local development.

### Build and launch locally

For development and quick evaluation, double-click
[`Launch RepoPrompt CE.command`](Launch%20RepoPrompt%20CE.command) in Finder.

The launcher requires Python 3, builds RepoPrompt CE through the coordinated
developer daemon, opens the debug app, and keeps a small terminal window
available for rebuild, status, and stop controls. It does not provide an
uncoordinated no-Python fallback because lifecycle actions validate the exact
debug executable path.

The debug launcher uses an available `Apple Development:` signing identity. If
your Mac does not have one, run the same debug app from Terminal with explicit
ad-hoc signing:

```bash
ALLOW_ADHOC_SIGNING=1 ./conductor app relaunch
```

Ad-hoc debug builds use in-memory secure storage, so saved API keys and secure
permission changes do not persist across launches. For persistent debug
Keychain storage, pass a stable Apple Development identity explicitly:

```bash
SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)" ./conductor app relaunch
```

For a stable locally signed app under `/Applications`, use the local production
installer below. Its self-signed identity is separate from the debug launcher's
Apple Development signing path.

> **Note:** If you use the debug app to modify RepoPrompt CE itself, validation
> flows that launch the app or run live smoke checks may rebuild and relaunch it.
> Expect the debug app to restart while those checks run.

| Key | Action                                      |
| --- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `r` | Rebuild and relaunch                        |
| `s` | Show app status                             |
| `x` | Stop the app                                |
| `q` | Close the launcher without stopping the app |

### Install a local production build

For a release-mode app under `/Applications`, install Python 3 and double-click
[`Install RepoPrompt CE Local Production.command`](Install%20RepoPrompt%20CE%20Local%20Production.command)
in Finder. The Finder launcher uses the coordinated developer daemon.

The installer builds RepoPrompt CE from source and replaces any existing
`/Applications/RepoPrompt CE.app` using a dedicated self-signed certificate
trusted only on your Mac. macOS may ask you to approve the certificate.

The resulting app is local-only. It is not notarized and should not be copied to
another Mac or redistributed.

### Source-build requirements

- macOS 26 or later
- Xcode 26, or matching Command Line Tools with the macOS 26 SDK

## Features

- **Context engineering**: Build dense, reviewable prompts with the files and
  repository details an AI model actually needs.
- **Codebase orientation**: Combine file trees, selected file contents, line
  slices, CodeMaps, and Git diffs.
- **Context Builder**: Let an agent explore the repository, identify relevant
  files, and curate context within a token budget.
- **Agent orchestration**: Run and coordinate CLI-backed coding agents from the
  native macOS app. See [`docs/worktrees.md`](docs/worktrees.md) for app-managed
  worktrees and `.worktreeinclude` local file copying.
- **MCP server and CLI integration**: Connect external MCP-compatible tools and
  CLI agents to RepoPrompt CE's repository context and agent harness.
- **Multi-root workspaces**: Work across related repositories, packages, and
  documentation folders in one workspace.
- **Reviewable handoffs**: Inspect and refine selected context before sending it
  to another model or agent.

## About the Community Edition

RepoPrompt CE is the free, open-source community edition of RepoPrompt. It is a
native macOS workspace for context engineering, agent orchestration, and local
development.

Maintainers track release signing, Sparkle metadata, dependency pins, and
third-party notices in
[`docs/open-source-readiness.md`](docs/open-source-readiness.md).
