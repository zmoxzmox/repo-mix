# SwiftPM Attribution Bundle

RepoPrompt CE packages the upstream license and notice files for every remote
dependency resolved by the root Swift package graph.

[`inventory.tsv`](inventory.tsv) is the machine-checkable inventory. Its columns
are:

```text
identity    resolved version or revision    upstream repository    notice bundle
```

Packages with a directory in this folder preserve the top-level license and
notice files shipped by the exact resolved checkout. `swift-nio/CNIOLLHTTP`
also preserves the license for the compiled llhttp-derived C target.

Tree-sitter grammar packages and `SwiftTreeSitter` use the separately curated
[`../tree-sitter/`](../tree-sitter/) bundle. That bundle includes the linked
grammar snapshots, wrapper license, resolved runtime license, and ICU subset
notice. Its own `SHA256SUMS` file protects the complete curated bundle.

One source-control requirement is an intentional release-gap exception: Neon
remains at revision
`07a325403534f4759c814aff0a58ac69144a524c` because its latest release, 0.6.0,
is older and incompatible with the exact SwiftTreeSitter 0.10.0 graph.

[`SHA256SUMS`](SHA256SUMS) records checksums for the copied notice files. Run:

```bash
./Scripts/swiftpm_notice_guardrails.sh
```

after changing `Package.resolved` or any copied notice file.
