            Short-lived, read-only explore child agents for narrow codebase probes. Each child runs in a fresh session with its own context window. Always uses the `explore` role; no custom `model_id`, workflows, session reuse, `steer`, or `respond`.

            Explore children inherit the caller's worktree bindings by default; pass `inherit_worktree=false` to opt out. Start-only worktree controls can bind an existing worktree or create one before provider startup, overriding an inherited primary-root binding. Multi-message creates produce one worktree per child when branch/path are implicit and reject a shared explicit branch or path.

            **Operations**: start | poll | wait | cancel

            - `start`: Launch one or more fresh explore sessions. Provide `message` for one probe or `messages` for multiple probes. Batch starts wait for the first referenced session to finish or need input unless `detach=true`.
            - `poll`: Return current snapshot immediately for `session_id` or `session_ids`.
            - `wait`: Block until the first referenced explore run finishes or needs input. `timeout=0` behaves like poll.
            - `cancel`: Cancel a live explore child session.

            Explore children are read-only — no edits, oracle calls, or further sub-agent spawning.

            Spawn and control Agent Mode sessions. `start` always creates a new session/tab; use `steer` to continue an existing session.

            **Role labels** — pass as `model_id` to select via the global role-default mapping:
            - `explore` — Fast exploration and codebase mapping
            - `engineer` — Balanced engineering work
            - `pair` — Interactive pair programming with highest-tier models
            - `design` — Architecture, design discussions, creative problem solving; writes a markdown review document (saved under `docs/reviews/`, `docs/designs/`, or `docs/analysis/`) as its primary deliverable for review/analysis tasks

            Role labels resolve through the effective global role-default mapping; see the top-level `task_labels` array from `agent_manage.list_agents` for the authoritative label→model mapping. If `model_id` is omitted on `start`, RepoPrompt uses the `pair` role. To pin an exact agent+model+effort target, pass a specific compound `model_id` from `agents[].models[].model_id` in the same response.

            **Operations**: start | poll | wait | cancel | steer | respond

            - `start`: Launch an agent run in a **new** session/tab. Do NOT pass `session_id` — use `steer` to continue an existing session. Omit `model_id` to use the `pair` role, or pass `model_id` with a role label (resolved via the global role-default mapping in `agent_manage.list_agents` `task_labels`) or an explicit compound `model_id` from `agents[].models[].model_id`. When started from an Agent Mode run, the new child session inherits the source session's worktree bindings by default; pass `inherit_worktree=false` to keep parent session threading but skip worktree inheritance. Optional start-only worktree args can bind the new session to an existing worktree (`worktree`/`worktree_id`) or create an app-managed worktree (`worktree_create=true`) before provider startup; explicit worktree args take precedence, suppress parent inheritance, and bind only the requested worktree. Returns a `session_id` — save it for all follow-up calls. Waits up to `timeout` seconds (default \(defaultWaitSeconds)). Pass `detach: true` to return immediately.
            - `poll`: Return current snapshot immediately. Accepts `session_id` (single) or `session_ids` (array — returns all current snapshots).
            - `wait`: Block until the run finishes or needs input. Default \(defaultWaitSeconds)s. `timeout: 0` = poll. Accepts `session_id` (single) or `session_ids` (array — returns when first session reaches interesting state). Returns `interaction_id` when input is pending.
            - `cancel`: Stop an active agent run. Only valid when the run is `running` or `waiting_for_input`. Requires `session_id`.
            - `steer`: Continue an existing agent session by sending a follow-up instruction to the `session_id` returned by `start`. If the run is still active, the instruction is steered into that run; if the last run already finished or the MCP wait/control handle expired, RepoPrompt reactivates the existing Agent session and starts the next run in the same session when it still exists. Pass `wait: true` (or `timeout_seconds`) to block until the steered run finishes or needs input. Do NOT use `steer` when status is `waiting_for_input` — use `respond` instead.
            - `respond`: Resolve a pending interaction (question, approval, MCP elicitation, etc). Requires `session_id` and `interaction_id` from the snapshot. The `interaction_id` is returned as a top-level field in poll/wait responses when input is pending. For MCP elicitation, use `response` (`accept`, `decline`, or `cancel`) plus optional object `content` and `meta`.

            **session_id lifecycle**: `start` creates a new session and returns `session_id` in the response. All subsequent operations on that run require passing the same `session_id` back. Do NOT invent session IDs — always use the value returned by `start`.

            **Sub-agent spawning**: MCP-started `orchestrate` runs can dispatch sub-agents. Sub-agents cannot recursively start additional agent runs.

            **Parallel agents**: When launching multiple agents in parallel, always use `detach: true` so each `start` returns immediately without blocking. You can then `wait` or `poll` each `session_id` independently.

            **IMPORTANT — never end your turn with active agents**: Sub-agents may need approval for tool calls or ask questions via `waiting_for_input`. Always `wait`/`poll` on every started session and `respond` to any pending interactions before finishing your turn. An unattended agent will stall indefinitely.

            - `list_agents`: Returns top-level `task_labels` as the authoritative role-label→model mapping (explore, engineer, pair, design), plus `agents[].models[]` with explicit compound `model_id` targets for callers that want to pin a specific agent/model/effort. Use `task_labels` entries for role-based routing; use `agents[].models[].model_id` for exact selections. Pass `roles_only=true` to return only `task_labels` and omit the explicit per-agent target catalog.
            - `list_sessions`: Browse sessions. Returns `session_id` for each session. Filter by MCP-facing `state` (e.g. `running`, `waiting_for_input`, `completed`, `failed`). When called from agent mode, automatically scopes to sessions spawned by the current agent session.
            - `get_log`: Read faithful transcript XML for a session, preserving visible assistant/tool order without handoff compaction or narration pruning. Use `offset`/`limit` to page by turns.
            - `extract_handoff` (`handoff` alias): Export the full `<forked_session ...>` handoff XML for a live or persisted session. Persisted sessions export transcript-only payloads; `include_file_contents` is accepted only for a live source tab that is currently active so file selection can be snapshotted reliably. Use `output_path` to write to a file; inline XML is returned by default only when no output path is provided.
            - `create_session` / `resume_session`: Create or resume a session with a specific `model_id`.
            - `stop_session`: Stop a live session.
            - `cleanup_sessions`: Delete up to 256 specific MCP-originated sessions by ID. The entire array must contain unique valid UUID strings; any non-string, invalid UUID, or duplicate rejects the request before lookup or mutation. Only sessions started via MCP are eligible; user-created sessions are never deleted. Skips active sessions. Cancellation before mutation returns the current and remaining IDs as unprocessed/retry IDs. Cancellation after mutation starts reports the current ID as retryable `mutation_cancelled`, returns only later IDs as unprocessed/retry, and stops the batch. Per-ID lookup failures are `resolution_failed`. An open-tab persisted-delete failure after local teardown is `delete_partially_completed` with `durable=false` and `local_cleanup_completed=true`; persisted-only failures remain `delete_failed`. Missing or previously deleted IDs are `already_absent` and do not make an otherwise successful response partial. Use `list_sessions` first to find session IDs, then pass them here.
            - `list_workflows`: Discover workflows usable with `agent_run` operations, including `orchestrate` for planning, decomposition, and sub-agent dispatch.
