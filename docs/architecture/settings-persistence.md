# Settings persistence schema identity

RepoPrompt CE stores app-wide settings at:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/RepoPrompt CE/Settings/globalSettings.json
```

The file is identified by two fields, not one:

- `schemaLineage` answers **who wrote this settings family**.
- `schemaVersion` answers **whether this build can read that family version**.

`schemaVersion` is meaningful only after the lineage is known. CE inherited numeric
settings versions from classic/internal RepoPrompt builds, and some dev/live installs
already have unlineaged `schemaVersion` 3/4 files in live Application Support folders.
Those numbers must not be treated as CE-native just because CE eventually reaches the
same numeric version.

## Classification matrix

| `schemaLineage` | `schemaVersion` | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `repoprompt-ce.global-settings` | `<= currentSchemaVersion` | Load normally. Older CE files may be rewritten at the current schema. |
| `repoprompt-ce.global-settings` | `> currentSchemaVersion` | Preserve and block saves as a same-lineage future CE file. The UI does not offer compatible import for this lane. |
| any other non-empty value | any | Preserve and block saves as an incompatible/foreign schema. |
| absent | `<= legacyUnlineagedSchemaVersionCeiling` | Accept as legacy OSS CE. |
| absent | `> legacyUnlineagedSchemaVersionCeiling` | Preserve and block saves as incompatible/foreign, permanently. |
| header is undecodable but bytes are valid JSON | n/a | Preserve and block saves as incompatible/foreign. |
| bytes are not JSON | n/a | Back up as corrupt and write current defaults if the backup succeeds. |

## Frozen legacy ceiling

`GlobalSettingsDocument.legacyUnlineagedSchemaVersionCeiling` is intentionally frozen at
`2`: the last schema version OSS CE wrote without `schemaLineage`. Do not raise it when
`currentSchemaVersion` increases.

Classic/internal RepoPrompt wrote unlineaged v3/v4 `globalSettings.json` files before CE
introduced `schemaLineage`. An unlineaged version above the frozen ceiling is therefore
foreign forever, even after CE reaches v3/v4 numerically. This prevents old live/dev files
from being silently adopted and overwritten by a newer CE build.

The guardrail tests are:

- `SettingsJSONOnlyPersistenceTests.testLegacyUnlineagedCeilingIsFrozenAtTwo`
- `SettingsJSONOnlyPersistenceTests.testUnlineagedHigherSchemaStaysBlockedAfterFutureNumericSchemaCatchup`
- `SettingsJSONOnlyPersistenceTests.testVersionFourSettingsFileWithAgentModelsKeyIsPreserved`

## Recovery lanes

When persistence is blocked, the app runs with in-memory settings and refuses to overwrite
the preserved file until the user chooses an action:

- **Same-lineage future CE**: show the file or reset after backing it up. Compatible import
  is intentionally unavailable because an older build cannot know how to preserve future CE
  fields.
- **Incompatible/foreign JSON**: offer compatible import. Import backs up the original
  byte-for-byte, decodes CE-known fields, writes a current-schema CE file, and leaves
  unknown fields only in the backup.
- **Save failure**: offer retry before reset.

Every save re-checks the on-disk header before writing. This matters because CE dev builds
can share the live app support folder; a future/foreign file may appear after launch.
